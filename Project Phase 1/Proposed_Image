                                                  PROPOSED SYSTEM
                                                  
         The proposed system makes use of an embedded system based on GSM Technology and Internet of Things. To avoid the
accident, the automotive proximity sensor are deployed inside the car to find out the interruption in path . And to
ensure safety even after the accident an alert mechanism is governed which uses a GPS system to get position of the
vehicle and it sends to authorized person when the vehicle face the accident which is sensed by a vibration sensor. A
gas senor is used to found the drunken driver only if driver is not get dunked then only the ignition get start, the eye blink
sensor detects the drowsiness of the driver and give alert using the buzzer. All these status will be updated on the portal
using Internet of Things.
